To make the code work as expected, in the backend, you must:
1. create a folder named assets
2. add a video of your choice into the assets folder
3. create a frames folder inside assets
4. On line 33 in index.js, rename the filename to the name of the video you added into the assets folder
5. Of course, dont forget to "npm i" before you try starting the backend. Same for frontend.
